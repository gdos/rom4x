This is the ROM checksum diagnostic, and we currently patch around it
because it fails with the ROM 5X patches in place, for obvious reasons.
We could fix the checksum, or reclaim the space.
To patch around it in a reclaimable fashion, a the JSR instruction at
C53D and the following carry check and JSR must be patched out, easiest
by placing BRA C555 at C53D.
